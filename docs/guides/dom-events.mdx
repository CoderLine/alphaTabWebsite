title: DOM Events
---

> [!WARNING]
> Listening to alphaTab via DOM events has been deprecated in 1.5 and will be removed in 2.x. 

DOM Events are quite a common mechanism to signal special events from JavaScript frameworks. This practice
is quite common outside frontend frameworks like Angular or React and is known from frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

To reduce the number of event mechanisms we need to maintain and support, and to improve performance, DOM events will be removed in 2.x as a breaking change.
alphaTab anyhow requires a minimum degree of initialization via JavaScript (e.g. `new AlphaTabApi(element, settings)`) and therefore a migration to the JavaScript events is fairly simple.

Until the removal we will maintain backwards compatibility but at the same time we removed any documentation from the API reference related to it.

## Migration

To migrate, move any properties from the respective data attributes in the HTML DOM to a JavaScript settings object.

### Before

The event listeners are registered on the DOM element via `alphaTab.eventName`. The event data is contained in `e.detail`.

```html
<div id="alphaTab"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as alphaTab from '@coderline/alphaTab';
const element = document.querySelector('#alphaTab');
element.addEventListener('alphaTab.error', e => {
    sendErrorToAnalytics(e.detail);
}, false);
element.addEventListener('alphaTab.playerPositionChanged', e => {
    updatePlayerTime(e.detail);
}, false)

const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(element);
</script>
```

### After

The event listeners are registered via `api.eventName.on(listener)`. The event data is directly passed to the listener.

```html
<div id="alphaTab"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as alphaTab from '@coderline/alphaTab';
const element = document.querySelector('#alphaTab');
const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(element, settings);
api.error.on(error => {
    sendErrorToAnalytics(error);
});
api.playerPositionChanged.on(args => {
    updatePlayerTime(args);
});
</script>
```

title: Data Attributes
---

> [!WARNING]
> Configuring alphaTab via data attributes has been deprecated in 1.5 and will be removed in 2.x. 

HTML Data Attributes are quite a common mechanism to pass configurations from the DOM to JavaScript frameworks. This practice
is quite common outside frontend frameworks like Angular or React and is known from frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

To reduce the number of configuration mechanisms we need to maintain and support, the configuration with data attributes will be removed in 2.x as a breaking change. 
alphaTab anyhow requires a minimum degree of initialization via JavaScript (e.g. `new AlphaTabApi(element, settings)`) and therefore a migration to the settings object is fairly simple.
Developers can still decide to fill a settings object based on custom attribute needs.

Until the removal we will maintain backwards compatibility but at the same time we removed any documentation from the API reference related to it. 

## Migration

To migrate, move any properties from the respective data attributes in the HTML DOM to a JavaScript settings object.

### Before

The data attributes are added as `data-category-setting` to the DOM element. 

```html
<div id="alphaTab" 
        data-core-file="test.gp"
        data-display-layoutmode="horizontal" 
        data-player-enableplayer="true"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as alphaTab from '@coderline/alphaTab';
const element = document.querySelector('#alphaTab');
const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(element);
</script>
```

### After (JSON object)

The settings are defined in a plain JSON object (we have type definitions for it) according to the reference docs. 
The JSON object will be converted internally to the real settings object. Later motifications have to be done on `api.settings`.

```html
<div id="alphaTab"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as alphaTab from '@coderline/alphaTab';
const element = document.querySelector('#alphaTab');
/** @type {alphaTab.json.SettingsJson} */
const settings = {
    core: {
        file: element.dataset.file // you could still load data attributes yourself
    },
    display: {
        layoutMode: "horizontal" // or better: alphaTab.LayoutMode.Horizontal
    },
    player: {
        enablePlayer: true
    }
};
const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(element, settings);
</script>
```

### After (Settings object)

A new `Settings` instance is created and filled with the respective values on the defined properties. 
This is useful to make decisions based on default values or if you want to share the same object across 
multiple alphaTab instances.

```html
<div id="alphaTab"></div>
<script type="module">
import * as alphaTab from '@coderline/alphaTab';
const element = document.querySelector('#alphaTab');
const settings = new alphaTab.Settings();
settings.core.file = "test.gp";
settings.display.layoutMode = alphaTab.LayoutMode.Horizontal;
settings.player.enablePlayer = true;
const api = new alphaTab.AlphaTabApi(element, settings);
</script>
```

## Drum Tabs
AlphaTab uses the same drum tab notation as Guitar Pro 5. Since the guitar tab staff is not meaningful on 
percussion track, it's hidden in case a drum tab is displayed.

## Grand Staff
With Guitar Pro 6 files also grand staffs can be rendered.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/Piano.gpx" />

## Percussion <span class="badge badge--info badge--header">since 1.1.0-alpha.45</span>

Percussion tracks are similar to drum tabs but might have less lines than a normal staff.

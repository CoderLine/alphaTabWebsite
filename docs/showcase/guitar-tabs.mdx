## Rhythm
If you only display guitar tablatures, it might be interesting to add
rhythm stave to show the durations. You can do this either above or below
tablature.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/Rhythm.gp5" settings={ {
	staveProfile: 'tab', 
	notation: { rhythmMode: 'showwithbars'}
} } />

## Rhythm With Beams
If you prefer beams instead of bars for single notes you can have that too. 
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/Rhythm.gp5" settings={ {
	staveProfile: 'tab', 
	notation: { rhythmMode: 'showwithbeams'}
} } />

## String Variations
alphaTab will render tabs for stringed instruments. It takes care of 
number of strings and displays the tabs as you would expect.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/Tabs.gp5" settings={ {
	staveProfile: 'tab' 
} } />

## Score Details

The full score details are available as object dom. This way you can read and process any like you need. 

<ScoreDetails file="/files/features/Skillet.gp5"  />

## Song Details
Some of the layout engines can render the song details on top of the music sheet.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/SongDetails.gp5" />

## HTML5 Canvas

Do you prefer an HTML5 canvas output instead of SVG? No problem.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/SongDetails.gp5" settings={ {
	engine: 'html5' 
} } />

## Repeats
Need display repeat marks? No problem, single repeats and multiple repeats come out of the box.
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/Repeats.gp5" settings={ {
	staveProfile: 'score' 
} } />

## Alternate Endings
Even alternate repeat endings are no problem. 
<AlphaTab file="/files/features/AlternateEndings.gp5" settings={ {
	staveProfile: 'score' 
} } />

The guitar tuning of the current track is rendered on the top of the music notation.

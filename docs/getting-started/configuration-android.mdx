title: Configuration (Android)

Now with alphaTab [being part](/docs/getting-started/installation-android) of your project it is time for customization.
alphaTab has quite a list of settings, events and API methods to interact with.

## Setup

On the installation guide you already saw that the setup of alphaTab depends on the UI framework you're using. 

### Background Workers or Custom Controls

For non-UI usage there is not much more to say than: Use the classes available. This usage might be a bit more complicated
than relying on the pre-built UI components and will need some reading. Feel free to contact us if you need assistance on 
getting certain things to run.
Beside that, it might be the easiest to [check on how alphaTab is used](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/tree/develop/src.kontrol) to build the controls provided.

### Android Control

For normal Android UIs we provide a control with the main functionality out of the box. Just embed the control to your Layout XMLs and get hold of a reference to it. 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/main_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context="net.alphatab.android.MainActivity"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <alphaTab.AlphaTabView
        android:id="@+id/alphatab_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="parent"/>

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

In your activity code you can then interact with alphaTab by obtaining the reference to this control:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    private lateinit var _alphaTabView: AlphaTabView

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        _alphaTabView = findViewById(R.id.alphatab_view)

        val api = _alphaTabView.api;
        // use alphaTab
    }
}

```

## Settings

The settings are important to configure the display of alphaTab as you prefer it. 

The UI control exposes a `settings` property which can be used to change any desired configuration. 
Changes on the settings object itself are not automatically detected. It is required to call `_alphaTabView.api.updateSettings()` to trigger
an update of alphaTab. 

Additionally, a `tracks` property which can be filled to change the tracks being rendered by alphaTab.


## API

The main alphaTab API is available only on the UI controls via the `api` property. It provides a 
handy set of methods, properties and events to control alphaTab. 

```csharp
_alphaTabView.api.tex("\\title \"Hello AlphaTab\" . 3.3*4");
```

## Events

Event registration happens on the alphaTab classes. You can get an access to the main `AlphaTabApi` object via the `Api` property.
From there you use any APIs and methods exposed by alphaTab.

Events are subscribed and unsubscribed to via `eventName.on(handler)` and `eventName.off(handler)`. 

```kotlin
_alphaTabView.api.playedBeatChanged.on { beat -> {
    updateFretboard(beat)
}
```

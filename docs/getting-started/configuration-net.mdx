Now with alphaTab [being part](/docs/getting-started/installation-net) of your project it is time for customization.
alphaTab has quite a list of settings, events and API methods to interact with.

## Setup

On the installation guide you already saw that the setup of alphaTab depends on the UI framework you're using. 

### Console 

For non-UI usage there is not much more to say than: Use the classes available. This usage might be a bit more complicated
than relying on the pre-built UI components and will need some reading. Feel free to contact us if you need assistance on 
getting certain things to run. Beside that it might be the easiest to [check on how alphaTab](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/tree/develop/src.csharp) is used to built the controls provided. 

### WPF

For WPF we provide a control with the main functionality out of the box. Just embed the control to your XAML and hook it up
via code or via bindings. 

```xml
<Window x:Class="AlphaTab.Samples.Wpf.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:wpf="clr-namespace:AlphaTab.Wpf;assembly=AlphaTab.Windows"
        Title="AlphaTab" Height="800" Width="600" WindowState="Maximized">
    <wpf:AlphaTab Tracks="{Binding TracksToDisplay}">
    </wpf:AlphaTab>
</Window>
```

### WinForms

For WinForms we provide a similar control like for WPF despite it has a bit a reduced feature set. 
WinForms lacks of some capabilities to provide all features. The lack of proper transparency support
makes it hardly possible to show semi-transparent cursors during playback. When it comes to the 
available features of display and actual playback everything is there out of the box. 

Just drag an instance of the alphaTab control into your UI via the designer or set it up manually on code. 

```csharp
var control = new AlphaTab.WinForms.AlphaTabControl();
control.Dock = System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill;
this.Controls.Add(control);
control.Tracks = new []{ score.Tracks[0] };
```

## Settings

The settings are important to configure the display of alphaTab as you prefer it. 

For the console setup you will need to create manually a new instance of the `Settings` class and pass it on wherever it is needed. 

For the WPF and WinForms controls they expose a `Settings` property which can be used to change any desired configuration. 
Changes on the settings object itself are not automatically detected and it is required to call `control.Api.UpdateSettings()` to trigger
an update of alphaTab. 

Additionally both control expose a `Tracks` property which can be filled to change the tracks being rendered by alphaTab. 

## Events

Event registration happens on the alphaTab classes. For the console variant you would hook up to the events 
of the `ScoreRenderer` while for the UI controls you would hook up to the events of the `Api` property. 

Events are subscribed and unsubscribed via `EventName.On(handler)` and `EventName.Off(handler)`. 
AlphaTab is not using the C# event features in favor of consistency with the web version. 

```csharp
control.Api.PlayedBeatChanged.On(beat=> {
    UpdateFretboard(beat);
});
```

## API

The main alphaTab API is available only on the UI controls via the `Api` property. It provides a 
handy set of methods, properties and events to control alphaTab. 

```csharp
cs.Api.Tex("\\title \"Hello AlphaTab\" . 3.3*4");
```

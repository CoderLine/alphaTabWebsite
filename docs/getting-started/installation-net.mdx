Install packages like usual:  

**Core Package (.net standard 2.0)**

### Local Copy

While not recommended, you can grab the latest DLLs by downloading the Nupkg and unzipping it to your local folder. 
Afterwards you can reference the DLLs from this folder. 

## Initializing alphaTab

### Console

For console applications you would start using the low level API of alphaTab like the `ScoreLoader` and `ScoreRenderer`.
Usually, alphaTab provides controls UI platforms based on the `AlphaTabApi`. But for platforms where no UI is available,
just start using the normal classes that alphaTab provides. You can refer to the samples in the GitHub repository for some kick-starter code.

```cs
// load score
var score = AlphaTab.Importer.ScoreLoader.LoadScoreFromBytes(File.ReadAllBytes(args[0]));

// render score with svg engine and desired rendering width
var settings = new AlphaTab.Settings();
settings.Core.Engine = "skia";
var renderer = new AlphaTab.Rendering.ScoreRenderer(settings)
{
    Width = 970
};
var partialImages = new List<SKImage>();
var totalWidth = 0;
var totalHeight = 0;
renderer.PartialRenderFinished.On(r => { images.Add((SKImage) r.RenderResult); });
renderer.RenderFinished.On(r =>
{
    totalWidth = (int) r.TotalWidth;
    totalHeight = (int) r.TotalHeight;
});
renderer.RenderScore(score, new double[] { track.Index });
```

### WPF

For WPF we provide a UI control with the core functionality of alphaTab:

```xml
<Window x:Class="AlphaTab.Samples.Wpf.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:wpf="clr-namespace:AlphaTab.Wpf;assembly=AlphaTab.Windows"
        Title="AlphaTab" Height="800" Width="600" WindowState="Maximized">
    <wpf:AlphaTab Tracks="{Binding TracksToDisplay}">
    </wpf:AlphaTab>
</Window>
```

```cs
public IEnumerable<AlphaTab.Model.Track> TracksToDisplay { get; }
```

### WinForms

There is also a WinForms control that you can start using:

```cs
var control = new AlphaTab.WinForms.AlphaTabControl();
control.Dock = System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill;
this.Controls.Add(control);
control.Tracks = new []{ score.Tracks[0] };
```

### Additional Notes

You might want to check out the samples at https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTabSamplesDotNet to get a small impression
how to hook up things.

## Dependencies

For the .net Version alphaTab needs to rely on some 3rd party libraries to do certain operations. 

1. For rendering, either the built-in graphics library GDI+ can be used or alphaTab comes with a dependency to SkiaSharp for modern
cross platform rendering of images. Skia is the graphics engine used in Chrome and is proven to be fast and reliable.
We recommend using Skia as rendering engine over GDI+. 

2. For audio playback alphaTab comes with a dependency to NAudio which is used to play the synthesized sound.

title: Introduction

In the tutorials here we will build a small (web-) application which acts as general viewer
and player of music sheets. A similar version of the result we're building can be seen
on the [homepage of alphaTab](/). 

We will add a basic viewer that loads files from a given source. Then we will slowly extend this
simple display with more advanced features like: 

- Track selector
- User controls for changing the display
- Player

This tutorial does not need any pre-knowledge about how to use alphaTab but requires pre-knowledge about
either JavaScript or WPF with C#. As alphaTab is meant as an SDK and not as a drop-in solution it will be 
ultimately up to you to plan and design how your application should look like and behave. 

These tutorials are meant to learn all the required steps to configure and interact with alphaTab.

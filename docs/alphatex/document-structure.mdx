import { AlphaTexSample } from '@site/src/components/AlphaTexSample';

An alphaTex file is simply a list of bars and every bar has metadata and contents. For organizational reasons we commend
that metadata tags describing the general song information are added to the start of the file, and external media synchronization points are 
added on the end of the file: 

```title=General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
/* Song Contents */
/* Sync Points */
```

:::note
Before alphaTex 1.7 the 3 sections needed to be separated by a `.` This was improved in 1.7 and the separation dots should now be omitted.

```title=Pre 1.7 General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
.
/* Song Contents */
.
/* Sync Points */
```

## Bars

Bars (aka. measures) are starting with an optional list of metadata tags followed by the beats contained
in the bar. See [Bar Metadata](./bar-metadata.mdx) for details on the tags which can be applied here.

A bar is completed by a pipe `|` symbol

<AlphaTexSample>{`
// bar 1 metadata tags
\\clef G2 \\ks 
    // bar 1 contents
    Cb C4 
|  
// bar 2 metadata tags
\\ks A
    // bar 2 contents
    C4 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Beats

Beats group a number of notes played at the same time. The general parts of a beat are 

* `duration-change content duration effects multiplier`


<AlphaTexSample tracks={"all"}>{`
:4
    C4
    (C4 D4).8
    (C4 D4) { f }
    C4.16 * 2
    C4.4 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Duration change (optional)

A duration change allows easy changing of the duration for all following beats. The syntax is:

`:Duration` where `Duration` is a number describing the new duration:
* `:-4` a Quadruple Whole Note
* `:-2` a Double Note 
* `:1` a Whole Note
* `:2` a Half Note
* `:4` a Quarter Note 
* `:8` a 8th Note 
* `:16` a 16th Note
* `:32` a 32th Note
* `:64` a 64th Note
* `:128` a 128th Note 
* `:256` a 256th Note 

Optionally you can specify some properties afterwards the duration to specify tuplets.  

`:4 {tu 3 2}`

See [Tuplet Ranges](./beat-properties.mdx#TupletRanges) for more details.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:16 // 16th notes from here
    3.3
    4.3 
    5.3
    6.3
:4 { tu 3 } // quarter notes triplets
    3.3
    4.3
    5.3
:8 
    3.3 * 3
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Beat Content (required)

The most crucial and part is to describe the contents of a beat which can be one of these options:

* A rest
* Multiple notes played (grouped by parenthesis)
* A single note played

A rest is simply indicated by specifying an `r`: 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4 r r r r
`}</AlphaTexSample>

Multiple [Notes](#Notes) can be grouped with parenthesis `()`. Similar to the value lists, you can also just specify
one note and omit the parenthesis. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4 
    C4 // single note on beat
    (C4 E4) // multiple notes with parenthesis
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Beat Duration (optional)

Another way of specifying beat duration is to append them after the beat content as `. duration`.
Historically the new duration is also remembered for the next beat. Tuplets specified as beat effects will not be remembered.
<AlphaTexSample>{`
C4 .4
C4 .8
C4 // .8 remembered
C4 .2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Beat Effects (optional)

Beat effects can be applied as properties after the beat. See [Beat Properties](./beat-properties.mdx) to learn about all available effects.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4
    (C4 D4) { tp 8 } 
    C4 { f }
    r.2 {txt "Pause here"}
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Beat Multiplier (optional)

This feature allows repeating the same beat multiple times by "multiplying" them. 
Simply specify `* times` after the beat with `times` being the number of copies you want.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4
    // 4 times the same A-chord 
    (0.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 0.5) * 4 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Notes

Depending on the instrument played you can have one of 3 kinds of notes in your bars. 
Mixing is not possible so be sure to specify all notes consistently:

* Fretted and Stringed instruments like guitars have their notes as `fret.string`
* Percussion/Drums have their notes as articulation names. 
* Other pitched instruments have their notes as note names.

After each note the note effects can optionally be specified as properties: `note-value {note-properties}`.

:::info
AlphaTab tries to detect which kind of staff you are writing based on the first note.
:::

### Fretted Notes

If the current staff is a stringed instrument (`\tuning` or `\instrument` specified accordingly), 
notes are expressed as the fret and string the note is played on. The final note height is calculated. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:1
    (12.1 {sib} 14.2 {sib b (0 4)})
    12.1 { v }
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Percussion / Drum Notes

On percussion instruments, you specify the articulation which should be played as note. 
The percussion can be a quoted string or an identifier (name without quotes).

All details are described over at the [Percussion](./percussion.mdx) page.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
\\instrument percussion
\\articulation defaults
:4
    (KickHit RideBell) 
    r 
    KickHit 
    KickHit
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Pitched notes

Pitched notes are expressed in a combined name containing:

* The tone (`C`,`D`,`E`,`F`,`G`,`A`,`B`,`C`)
* The accidental (`#`, `b`, `bb`, `x`, `##`,..; see [Accidentals](./notes.mdx#accidentals) for details on accidental handling)
* The octave (a number)

<AlphaTexSample>{`
C4
C#4
Ebb4
Dx5 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Note Effects

See [Note Properties](./note-properties.mdx) for a list of all supported effects for notes. 


<AlphaTexSample>{`
:2
    3.3 { b (0 4) } // note bend
    (
        3.3 { v } // Vibrato
        3.2 { sib } // slide into from below
    )
`}</AlphaTexSample>

If you only have 1 note in the beat, you can specify both note and beat effects in the same property list.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:2
    // combined effects
    3.3 {
        b (0 4)     // note effect
        txt "Bend"  // beat effect
    }
    // separated effects 
    3.3 
        { b (0 4) }     // note effect
        { txt "Bend" }  // beat effect
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Tracks, Staves and Voices

A song might consist of multiple tracks and staves holding the song data. There are special metadata tags which mark the start
of such new structures. See [Structural Metadata](./structural-metadata.mdx) for more details.

<AlphaTexSample tracks={"all"}>{`
\\track "Track 1"
    \\staff {score} // first staff
        \\voice // first voice 
            C4 D4 E4 F4 | C4 D4 E4 F4
        \\voice // second voice
            C5 D5 E5 F5 | C5 D5 E5 F5
    \\staff {tabs} // second staff
        3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5 | 3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5
\\track "Track 2"
     1.2 3.2 5.2 6.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

You only need to specify these structural tags to start a new element. A first initial element is started implicitly.

<AlphaTexSample tracks={"all"}>{`
// first track
    // first staff
        // first voice 
            C4 D4 E4 F4 | C4 D4 E4 F4
        \\voice // second voice
            C5 D5 E5 F5 | C5 D5 E5 F5
    \\staff {tabs} // second staff
        3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5 | 3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5
\\track "Track 2"
     1.2 3.2 5.2 6.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

In this section you find all details about how to write music notation using AlphaTex.
AlphaTex is a text format for writing music notation for AlphaTab. AlphaTex loading
can be enabled by setting the [`tex`](/docs/reference/settings/core/tex) option or loading it via [`tex()`](/docs/reference/api/tex) method on the API.
AlphaTab will load the tex code from the element contents and parse it. You can also load it from a file like other formats.
AlphaTex supports most of the features alphaTab supports overall.
If you find anything missing you would like to see, feel free to
[initiate a Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/discussions/new) so we can find a good solution together.

## General Syntax

If you compare alphaTex to programming or scripting languages, you will find similar constructs. alphaTex (as the name implies) has borrowed
some aspects from LaTeX, a well known language for writing documents. As alphaTex evolved it came up with various own syntax constructs described here. 

When storing alphaTex to files, we recommend using the file extension `.atex`.

### Comments

Comments are supported in C-style comments via `// Single Line` and `/* Multi Line */`. You can use them anywhere within an alphaTex file
to further annotate your written document for structural or organizational purposes.

### Strings

Textual values are expressed as quoted strings similar to most programming languages. Both single and double quotes are supported. 

* `"Double Quoted String"`
* `'Single Quoted String'`

Additionally following escape sequences are supported:

* `\n` Newline
* `\r` Carriage Return
* `\t` Tab
* `\uXXXX` Unicode Character where XXXX is a 4 hex-digit number.
* `\\` A backslash 
* `\'` or `\"` a quote character 

### Numbers

alphaTex supports integer and decimal numbers.  Decimal numbers are only allowed in some dedicated places to avoid overlaps with some other syntax constructs.

Examples:

* `10`
* `-10`
* `0.5`
* `-4.5`

### Value Lists

At various places value lists are used to describe items like time signatures or bend points.
Value lists should be wrapped with parenthesis `(values)` if there are multiple values. If there is only a single value, the parenthesis can be omitted. 

The individual values can be: 

* Integer numbers: `3`, `-10`
* Decimal Numbers: `3.3`, `-10.5`
* Strings: `"Hello"`, `'Hello'`
* Special identifiers: `true`, `hide`, `x`


Basic Examples 

* `( 1 2 3 )`  A list of numbers
* `("Test" 3 hide)` A list of mixed type values 

Real examples

* `\ts (3 4)` A 3/4 time signature (specified on bar level)
* `12.2 { b (0 4 0) }` A note bend describing a full note bend and release
* `\title ("Song Title" "Title: %TITLE%" left)` A song title shown as `Title: Song Title` left aligned.

### Properties

Properties are a list of key-valuelist pairs describing additional optional aspects of elements.
They are used to add effects to notes and beats, what notations should be visible in a staff and more. 

Properties are always wrapped into curly braces. A property starts with an identifier describing the property, optionally followed by its values as value list. 

Examples: 
* `\track "Track Name" { color "#FF0000"}`
* `\staff {score}`
* `C4 {b (0 4) v txt "Bend with Vibrato"}`

### Metadata Tags

These are likely the most similar construct to LaTeX. Metadata are used to describe various elements within the data model.

The main syntax of metadata tags is: `\tag values {properties}`.
Both the `values` and `{properties}` are optional from a syntax perspective. Depending on the `tag` values might be expected to be specified.

Examples:

* `\title "Song Title"`
* `\track "Track Name" {color '#FF0000'}`
* `\ts (3 4)`

#### Metadata tag values

Metadata tags might have one or multiple values. The exact values supported (required or optional) depend on the tag.
See [Value Lists](#ValueLists) above for more details.

#### Metadata tag properties

Metadata tags might have one or multiple properties. The exact values supported depend on the tag.
See [Properties](#Properties) above for more details.

## General Song Structure

An alphaTex file is simply a list of bars and every bar has metadata and contents. For organizational reasons we commend
that metadata tags describing the general song information are added to the start of the file, and external media synchronization points are 
added on the end of the file: 

```title=General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
/* Song Contents */
/* Sync Points */
```

:::note
Before alphaTex 1.7 there was a need to separate the 3 sections with a dot `.`. This was improved in 1.7 and the separation dots should now be omitted.

```title=Pre 1.7 General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
.
/* Song Contents */
.
/* Sync Points */
```
:::

### Bars

Bars (aka. measures) are starting with an optional list of metadata tags followed by the beats contained
in the bar. See [Bar Metadata](./bar-metadata.mdx) for details on the tags which can be applied here.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
\\clef G2 \\ks Cb C4 | \\ks A C4 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Tracks, Staves and Voices

A song might consist of multiple tracks and staves holding the song data. There are special metadata tags which mark the start
of such new structures. See [Tracks and Staves](./tracks-staves.mdx) for more details.

<AlphaTexSample tracks={"all"}>{`
\\track "Track 1"
    \\staff {score} // first staff
        \\voice // first voice 
            C4 D4 E4 F4 | C4 D4 E4 F4
        \\voice // second voice
            C5 D5 E5 F5 | C5 D5 E5 F5
    \\staff {tabs} // second staff
        3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5 | 3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5
\\track "Track 2"
     1.2 3.2 5.2 6.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>


You only need to specify these structural tags to start a new element. A first initial element is started implicitly.

<AlphaTexSample tracks={"all"}>{`
// first track
    // first staff
        // first voice 
            C4 D4 E4 F4 | C4 D4 E4 F4
        \\voice // second voice
            C5 D5 E5 F5 | C5 D5 E5 F5
    \\staff {tabs} // second staff
        3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5 | 3.5 5.5 7.5 8.5
\\track "Track 2"
     1.2 3.2 5.2 6.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Beats

Beats group a number of notes played at the same time. The general parts of a beat are 

* `duration-change content duration effects multiplier`

#### Duration change (optional)

A duration change allows easy changing of the duration for all following beats. The syntax is:

`:Duration` where `Duration` is a number describing the new duration:
* `:-4` a Quadruple Whole Note
* `:-2` a Double Note 
* `:1` a Whole Note
* `:2` a Half Note
* `:4` a Quarter Note 
* `:8` a 8th Note 
* `:16` a 16th Note
* `:32` a 32th Note
* `:64` a 64th Note
* `:128` a 128th Note 
* `:256` a 256th Note 

Optionally you can specify some properties afterwards the duration to specify tuplets.  

`:4 {tu 3 2}`

See [Tuplet Ranges](./beat-effects.mdx#TupletRanges) for more details.

#### Beat Content (required)

The most crucial and part is to describe the contents of a beat which can be one of these options:

* A rest
* Multiple notes played (grouped by parenthesis)
* A single note played

A rest is simply indicated by specifying an `r`: 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4 r r r r
`}</AlphaTexSample>

Multiple [Notes](#Notes) can be grouped with parenthesis `()`. Similar to the value lists, you can also just specify
one note and omit the parenthesis. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4 
    C4 // single note on beat
    (C4 E4) // multiple notes with parenthesis
`}</AlphaTexSample>

#### Beat Duration (optional)

Another way of specifying beat duration is to append them after the beat content as `. duration`.
Historically the new duration is also remembered for the next beat. Tuplets specified as beat effects will not be remembered.
<AlphaTexSample>{`
C4 .4
C4 .8
C4 // .8 remembered
C4 .2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

#### Beat Effects (optional)

Beat effects can be applied as properties after the beat. See [Beat Effects](./beat-effects.mdx) to learn about all available effects.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4
    (C4 D4) { tp 8 } 
    C4 { f }
    r.2 {txt "Pause here"}
`}</AlphaTexSample>

#### Beat Multiplier (optional)

This feature allows "repeating" the same beat multiple times by "multiplying" them. 
Simply specify `* times` after the beat with `times` being the number of copies you want.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:4
    // 4 times the same A-chord 
    (0.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 0.5) * 4 
`}</AlphaTexSample>

### Notes

All previous elements are useless, if we cannot specify any notes to be played in the song. 
Depending on the instrument played you can have one of 3 kinds of notes in your bars. 
Mixing is not possible so be sure to specify all notes consistently:

* Fretted and Stringed instruments like guitars have their notes as `fret.string`
* Percussion/Drums have their notes as articulation names. 
* Other pitched instruments have their notes as note names.

After each note the note effects can optionally be specified as properties: `note-value {note-properties}`.

If you only have 1 note in the beat, you can specify both note and beat effects in the same property list.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:2
    // combined effects
    3.3 {
        b (0 4)     // note effect
        txt "Bend"  // beat effect
    }
    // separated effects 
    3.3 
        { b (0 4) }     // note effect
        { txt "Bend" }  // beat effect
`}</AlphaTexSample>

:::info
AlphaTab tries to detect which kind of staff you are writing based on the first note.
:::

#### Fretted Notes

If the current staff is a stringed instrument (`\tuning` or `\instrument` specified accordingly), 
notes are expressed as the fret and string the note is played on. The final note height is calculated. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
:1
    (12.1 {sib} 14.2 {sib b (0 4)})
    12.1 { v }
`}</AlphaTexSample>

#### Percussion / Drum Notes

On percussion instruments, you specify the articulation which should be played as note. 
The percussion can be a quoted string or an identifier (name without quotes).

All details are described over at the [Percussion](./percussion.mdx) page.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
\\instrument percussion
\\articulation defaults
:4
    (KickHit RideBell) 
    r 
    KickHit 
    KickHit
`}</AlphaTexSample>

#### Pitched notes

Pitched notes are expressed in a combined name containing:

* The tone (`C`,`D`,`E`,`F`,`G`,`A`,`B`,`C`)
* The accidental (`#`, `b`, `bb`, `x`, `##`,..; see [Accidentals](./notes.mdx#accidentals) for details on accidental handling)
* The octave (a number)

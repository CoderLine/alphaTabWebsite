The following examples show how to write general notes. Multiple bars are
separated by a vertical bar `|`.

## Single notes and rests

Notes follow the format `fret.string.duration`. For rests
the fret is simply replaced with `r`. The duration is specified
as a number where 1 represents a full note, 2 a half note and so on. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
0.6.2 1.5.4 3.4.4 | 
5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 r.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Chords

To specify multiple notes on a beat, group them in parentheses. The full format is
`(fret.string fret.string ...).duration`.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (0.3 0.4).8 |
r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 r.8 (6.3 6.4).8 (5.3 5.4).4 r.4 |
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 |
r.8 (0.3 0.4).8
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Duration Ranges

To make it simpler to write notes, you can apply the same duration to 
multiple notes. Start a new duration range with `:duration`.
The following notes will all have this duration. AlphaTex also remembers
the last explictely set duration and will take use it in case of a missing duration.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
// explicit ranges via :duration
:4 2.3 3.3 :8 3.3 4.3 3.3 4.3 | 
// implicit ranges via beat duration
2.3.4 3.3 3.3.8 4.3 3.3 4.3
`}</AlphaTexSample>


## Repeat beats

You can specify a multiplier after a beat to add the same beat multiple times to the score. 

<AlphaTexSample>{`
3.3*4 | 4.3*4
`}</AlphaTexSample>

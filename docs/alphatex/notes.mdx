The following examples show how to write general notes. Multiple bars are
separated by a vertical bar `|`.

## Single notes and rests

Notes follow the format `fret.string.duration`. For rests
the fret is simply replaced with `r`. The duration is specified
as a number where 1 represents a full note, 2 a half note and so on.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
0.6.2 1.5.4 3.4.4 |
5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 r.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Chords

To specify multiple notes on a beat, group them in parentheses. The full format is
`(fret.string fret.string ...).duration`.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (0.3 0.4).8 |
r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 r.8 (6.3 6.4).8 (5.3 5.4).4 r.4 |
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 |
r.8 (0.3 0.4).8
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Duration Ranges

To make it simpler to write notes, you can apply the same duration to
multiple notes. Start a new duration range with `:duration`.
The following notes will all have this duration. AlphaTex also remembers
the last explicitly set duration and will take use it in case of a missing duration.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
// explicit ranges via :duration
:4 2.3 3.3 :8 3.3 4.3 3.3 4.3 |
// implicit ranges via beat duration
2.3.4 3.3 3.3.8 4.3 3.3 4.3
`}</AlphaTexSample>


## Repeat beats

You can specify a multiplier after a beat to add the same beat multiple times to the score.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
3.3*4 | 4.3*4
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Multiple voices

            
## Accidentals

alphaTab places accidentals automatically but in some cases it is desired to force a particular accidental
to be used for a note. When using pitched note, you already specify the note heights using accidentals and unless 
the accidental mode is changed from `\accidentals explicit` (default) to `\accidentals auto` the accidentals will be used as specified.

Specify `\accidentals explicit` to change alphaTex to respect the exactly specified accidentals. The accidentals in notes can be 

- `#` - Sharp 
- `b` - Flat
- `bb` - Double Flat
- `x` or '##' - Double Sharp

Alternatively the accidental can also be specified in the note effect list via `acc accidental` where accidental can be 

- `default`, `d` - Default (Automatic) Accidental
- `forceNone`, `-` - Force to have no accidental
- `forceNatural`, `b` - Force to have a naturalize accidental
- `forceSharp`, `#` - Force to have a sharp accidental
- `forceDoubleSharp`, `##`, `x` - Force to have a double-sharp accidental
- `forceFlat`, `b` - Force to have a flat accidental
- `forceDoubleFlat`, `bb`, Force to have a double-flat accidental

Keep in mind that a change in accidental might result in a change of the note height and some combinations are not directly possible.
alphaTab will do its best to keep the notes correct.

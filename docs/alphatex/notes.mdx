The following examples show how to write general notes. Multiple bars are
separated by a vertical bar `|`.

## Single notes and rests

Notes follow the format `fret.string.duration`. For rests
the fret is simply replaced with `r`. The duration is specified
as a number where 1 represents a full note, 2 a half note and so on.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
0.6.2 1.5.4 3.4.4 |
5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 5.3.8 r.2
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Chords

To specify multiple notes on a beat, group them in parentheses. The full format is
`(fret.string fret.string ...).duration`.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (0.3 0.4).8 |
r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 r.8 (6.3 6.4).8 (5.3 5.4).4 r.4 |
(0.3 0.4).4 (3.3 3.4).4 (5.3 5.4).4 r.8 (3.3 3.4).8 |
r.8 (0.3 0.4).8
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Duration Ranges

To make it simpler to write notes, you can apply the same duration to
multiple notes. Start a new duration range with `:duration`.
The following notes will all have this duration. AlphaTex also remembers
the last explicitly set duration and will take use it in case of a missing duration.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
// explicit ranges via :duration
:4 2.3 3.3 :8 3.3 4.3 3.3 4.3 |
// implicit ranges via beat duration
2.3.4 3.3 3.3.8 4.3 3.3 4.3
`}</AlphaTexSample>


## Repeat beats

You can specify a multiplier after a beat to add the same beat multiple times to the score.

<AlphaTexSample>{`
3.3*4 | 4.3*4
`}</AlphaTexSample>

## Multiple voices

alphaTab supports showing multiple independent voices within one bar, to write such notation in alphaTex the `\voice` syntax can be used to start a new voice. 
Once a new voice starts, you again can define the notes starting from the first bar. alphaTab will try to consolidate inconsistencies in the number of bars across voices.

            c3 d3 e3 f3

`}</AlphaTexSample>
            
## Accidentals

alphaTab places accidentals automatically but in some cases it is desired to force a particular accidental
to be used for a note. When using pitched note, you already specify the note heights using accidentals and unless 
the accidental mode is changed from `\accidentals explicit` (default) to `\accidentals auto` the accidentals will be used as specified.

Specify `\accidentals explicit` to change alphaTex to respect the exactly specified accidentals. The accidentals in notes can be 

- `#` - Sharp 
- `b` - Flat
- `bb` - Double Flat
- `x` or '##' - Double Sharp

Alternatively the accidental can also be specified in the note effect list via `acc accidental` where accidental can be 

- `default`, `d` - Default (Automatic) Accidental
- `forceNone`, `-` - Force to have no accidental
- `forceNatural`, `b` - Force to have a naturalize accidental
- `forceSharp`, `#` - Force to have a sharp accidental
- `forceDoubleSharp`, `##`, `x` - Force to have a double-sharp accidental
- `forceFlat`, `b` - Force to have a flat accidental
- `forceDoubleFlat`, `bb`, Force to have a double-flat accidental

Keep in mind that a change in accidental might result in a change of the note height and some combinations are not directly possible.
alphaTab will do its best to keep the notes correct.

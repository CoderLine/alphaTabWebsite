title: Language Syntax
---

If you compare alphaTex to programming or scripting languages, you will find similar constructs in this language. alphaTex (as the name implies) has borrowed
some aspects from LaTeX, a well known language for writing documents. As alphaTex evolved it came up with various own syntax constructs described here. 

When storing alphaTex to files, we recommend using the file extension `.atex`.

## Comments

Comments are supported in C-style comments via `// Single Line` and `/* Multi Line */`. You can use them anywhere within an alphaTex file
to further annotate your written document for structural or organizational purposes.

## Strings

Textual values are expressed as quoted strings similar to most programming languages. Both single and double quotes are supported. 

* `"Double Quoted String"`
* `'Single Quoted String'`

Additionally following escape sequences are supported:

* `\n` Newline
* `\r` Carriage Return
* `\t` Tab
* `\uXXXX` Unicode Character where XXXX is a 4 hex-digit number.
* `\\` A backslash 
* `\'` or `\"` a quote character 

## Numbers

alphaTex supports integer and decimal numbers.  Decimal numbers are only allowed in some dedicated places to avoid overlaps with some other syntax constructs.

Examples:

* `10`
* `-10`
* `0.5`
* `-4.5`

## Value Lists

At various places value lists are used to describe items like time signatures or bend points.
Value lists should be wrapped with parenthesis `(values)` if there are multiple values. If there is only a single value, the parenthesis can be omitted. 

The individual values can be: 

* Integer numbers: `3`, `-10`
* Decimal Numbers: `3.3`, `-10.5`
* Strings: `"Hello"`, `'Hello'`
* Special identifiers: `true`, `hide`, `x`


Basic Examples 

* `( 1 2 3 )`  A list of numbers
* `("Test" 3 hide)` A list of mixed type values 

Real examples

* `\ts (3 4)` A 3/4 time signature (specified on bar level)
* `12.2 { b (0 4 0) }` A note bend describing a full note bend and release
* `\title ("Song Title" "Title: %TITLE%" left)` A song title shown as `Title: Song Title` left aligned.

## Properties

Properties are a list of key-valuelist pairs describing additional optional aspects of elements.
They are used to add effects to notes and beats, what notations should be visible in a staff and more. 

Properties are always wrapped into curly braces. A property starts with an identifier describing the property, optionally followed by its values as value list. 

Examples: 
* `\track "Track Name" { color "#FF0000"}`
* `\staff {score}`
* `C4 {b (0 4) v txt "Bend with Vibrato"}`

Property identifiers are case-insensitive.

## Metadata Tags

Metadata tags are the most similar construct to LaTeX. Metadata are used to describe various elements within the data model.

The main syntax of metadata tags is: `\tag values {properties}`.
Both the `values` and `{properties}` are optional from a syntax perspective. Depending on the `tag` values might be expected to be specified.

Examples:

* `\title "Song Title"`
* `\track "Track Name" {color '#FF0000'}`
* `\ts (3 4)`

Metadata tags identifiers are case-insensitive.

### Metadata tag values

Metadata tags might have one or multiple values. The exact values supported (required or optional) depend on the tag.
See [Value Lists](#value-lists) above for more details.

### Metadata tag properties

Metadata tags might have one or multiple properties. The exact values supported depend on the tag.
See [Properties](#properties) above for more details.

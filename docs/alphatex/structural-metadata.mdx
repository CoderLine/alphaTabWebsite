For some songs you might want to define that the song has multiple tracks, staves or voices.

* Multiple tracks are used when multiple instruments are playing together in one song.
* Multiple staves are typically used to write grand staff piano notation (left hand/right hand) or 
  splitup voices for readability. 
* Multiple voices are typically used to write notation where multiple independent timings and pitches are played. 
  This can be if multiple vocals are singing together (hence the name voices), or special playing techniques (playing a base rhythm and melody on the same instrument). 

In alphaTex new tracks, staves and voices are started with their respective metadata tags specified at the start of a bar:

* `\track`
* `\staff`
* `\voice`

alphaTab refers to these kind of metadata tags as "structural" tags as they define the general structure of the song.

The initial track, staff or voice is implicitly started. Only on the "second" item you need to specify the tags. For clarity
it is encouraged to also specify the initial item if there are multiple tracks, staves or voices.

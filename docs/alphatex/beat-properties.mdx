title: Beat Properties

import { AlphaTexSample } from '@site/src/components/AlphaTexSample';

The properties defined on beat level result in a variety of effects and annotations
shown in the music sheet. Historically these properties are heavily abbreviated to 
reduce the text that needs to be written to apply them. 

In future alphaTab will likely change to a more verbose, but clearer alternative.

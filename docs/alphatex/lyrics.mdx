title: Lyrics
---

The lyrics system of alphaTab is borrowed from Guitar Pro. For every track multiple "lines" of lyrics can be defined which can either start at the beginning or at a later bar. 
The syllables of the procided lyrics are spread automatically across the beats of the track. Syllables are separated with spaces. 
If multiple words/syllables should stay on the same beat the space can be replaced with a `+`. 
Comments which should not be displayed can be put `[into brackets]`.

To add lyrics to a track use the `\lyrics "Text"` or `\lyrics StartBar "Text"` metadata tag on track/staff level.

Here some samples:

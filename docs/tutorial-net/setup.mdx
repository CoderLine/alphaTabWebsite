title: Setup Project
---

First we will set the stage for our new application. 
We launch Visual Studio and create a new project of type **WPF App (.NET core)**.

Then we enter some project name and choose a location.

As a last step for the setup we will install the NuGet package `AlphaTab.Windows`
which will contain the most important controls for our usage. 

Right-Click on the References in the Solution Explorer and choose Manage NuGet Packages...

Then search for the package `AlphaTab.Windows` and install it.

Additionally install the `FontAwesome.Sharp` package which we will use for some icons 
in the UI. With this is everything we need to actually get started on developing.

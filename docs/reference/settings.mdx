import ReferenceTable from '../../src/reference-table';

This section contains a list of all properties that allow configuration of the alphaTab behavior.

There are multiple ways how settings in alphaTab can be specified.For.net simply the normal classes are used and
changes are signaled via `UpdateSettings` call.For JavaScript the interaction with the settings is a bit more sensitive
due to the lack of type safety and the support of JSON based settings.

Not all settings contain reasonable examples as they often just activate something within alphaTab
or change the display of some notation.If you have questions on certain settings feel free to open a
[issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/issues/new/choose)

The first and most important rule is: when interacting with the settings object directly, the correct structure and data types
must be followed not to break alphaTab or make the changes useless. In order to simplify things when configuring alphaTab via JavaScript
there are 2 additional features:

1. AlphaTab can be configured via a simple plain JSON object.
This JSON format supports some aliases and also some value conversions like for enums, fonts and colors.
	This JSON schema can only be used at selected places.When attempting to set JSON values on the derives`alphaTab.Settings` object,
	this can lead to unexpected side effects.The JSON schema can be used when initializing alphaTab or by calling `settings.fillFromJson( ... )`.

2. AlphaTab can be configured via HTML data attributes
All settings can also be added as data attributes on the element for which alphaTab is initialized.This is especially useful
when multiple different instances of alphaTab are running on the same site but the main code to setup alphaTab should be shared.
Individual settings can be specified on HTML elements.

The following table contains all the properties as they can be set on the general settings object.

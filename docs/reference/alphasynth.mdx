import ReferenceTable from '../../src/reference-table';

`AlphaSynth` is one of the low level APIs that can be used if no full alphaTab API object with UI interaction
can be used or is needed. It is the audio synthesis engine of alphaTab which is used to play a midi file
using a generated midi file and a SoundFont as input. 

This page describes all methods, properties and events exposed by this class. Most of the API methods exposed by
the `IAlphaSynth` interface are also directly available on the normal API object. That's why many documentation pages
delegate to the related documentation pages there.

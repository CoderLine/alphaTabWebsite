## Description
The score renderer used for rendering the music sheet. This is the low-level API responsible for the actual rendering engine.
Gets access to the underling [`IScoreRenderer`](/docs/reference/plain/iscorerenderer.mdx) that is used for the rendering.

### [alphaTab.rendering.IScoreRenderer](/docs/reference/plain/iscorerenderer.mdx) Properties

Represents the public interface of the component that can render scores.

        Gets or sets the lookup which allows fast access to beats at a given position.

    <ParameterRow platform="js" name="width" type="number">
        The width of the rendered score. For layouts that grow from top to bottom (like `page`), it is required to specify a width for the renderer.
        The renderer will fit then the bars into this area for rendering. The alphaTab API object uses a link to the
        graphical user interface via a [`IUiFacade`](/docs/reference/plain/iuifacade.mdx) to get the available width for rendering. When using the low-level APIs
        this width must be specified manually.
        
        For layouts that grow from left to right the width and height are usually calculated automatically based on
        the contents.

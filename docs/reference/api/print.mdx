<SinceBadge since="0.9.4" />

### Description
Opens a popup window with the rendered music notation for printing. Opens a popup window with the rendered music notation for printing. The default display of alphaTab in the browser is not very
suitable for printing. The items are lazy loaded, the width can be dynamic, and the scale might be better suitable for screens.
This function opens a popup window which is filled with a by-default A4 optimized view of the rendered score:

* Lazy loading is disabled
* The scale is reduced to 0.8
* The stretch force is reduced to 0.8
* The width is optimized to A4. Portrait if the page-layout is used, landscape if the horizontal-layout is used.

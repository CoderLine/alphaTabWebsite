<PropertyDescription />
The tick cache allowing lookup of midi ticks to beats. In older versions of alphaTab you can access the `boundsLookup` via <Signature style="inline" js={[["identifier","boundsLookup","/docs/reference/types/rendering/iscorerenderer#boundslookup"]]}>boundsLookup</Signature>  on <Signature style="inline" js={[["identifier","renderer","/docs/reference/types/alphatabapibase#renderer"]]}>renderer</Signature> .

After the rendering completed alphaTab exposes via this lookup the location of the individual
notation elements. The lookup provides fast access to the bars and beats at a given location.
If the <Signature style="inline" js={[["identifier","CoreSettings.includeNoteBounds","/docs/reference/settings/core/includenotebounds"]]}>CoreSettings.includeNoteBounds</Signature>  option was activated also the location of the individual notes can be obtained.

The property contains a `BoundsLookup` instance which follows a hierarchical structure that represents
the tree of rendered elements.

The hierarchy is: `staffSystems > bars(1) > bars(2) > beats > notes`

* `staffSystems` - Represent the bounds of the individual systems ("rows") where staves are contained.
* `bars(1)` - Represent the bounds of all bars for a particular master bar across all tracks.
* `bars(2)` - Represent the bounds of an individual bar of a track. The bounds on y-axis span the region of the staff and notes might exceed this bounds.
* `beats` - Represent the bounds of the individual beats within a track. The bounds on y-axis are equal to the bar bounds.
* `notes` - Represent the bounds of the individual note heads/numbers within a track.

Each bounds hierarchy have a `visualBounds` and `realBounds`.

* `visualBounds` - Represent the area covering all visually visible elements
* `realBounds` - Represents the actual bounds of the elements in this beat including whitespace areas.
* `noteHeadBounds` (only on `notes` level) - Represents the area of the note heads or number based on the staff

You can check out the individual sizes and regions.

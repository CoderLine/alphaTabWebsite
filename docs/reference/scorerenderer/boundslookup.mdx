## Description
After the rendering completed alphaTab exposes via this lookup the location of the individual
notation elements. The lookup provides fast access to the bars and beats at a given location.
If the [`IncludeNoteBounds`](/docs/reference/settings/core/includenotebounds) option was activated
also the location of the individual notes can be obtained. 

<PropertyDescription metadata={metadata} />

The property contains a `BoundsLookup` instance which follows a hierarchical structure that represents
the tree of rendered elements. 

The hierarchy is: `staveGroups > bars(1) > bars(2) > beats > notes`

* `staveGroups` - Represent the bounds of the invidual "lines" where staves are contained. 
* `bars(1)` - Represent the bounds of all bars for a particular master bar across all tracks.
* `bars(2)` - Represent the bounds of an individual bar of a track. The bounds on y-axis span the region of the staff and notes might exceed this bounds. 
* `beats` - Represent the bounds of the individual beats within a track. The bounds on y-axis are equal to the bar bounds.
* `notes` - Represent the bounds of the individual note heads/numbers within a track. 

Each bounds hierarchy have a `visualBounds` and `realBounds`. 

* `visualBounds` - Represent the area covering all visually visible elements
* `realBounds` - Represents the actual bounds of the elements in this beat including whitespace areas. 
* `noteHeadBounds` (only on `notes` level) - Represents the area of the note heads or number based on the staff

## Description
For layouts that grow from top to bottom (like `page`), it is required to specify a width for the renderer.
The renderer will fit then the bars into this area for rendering. The alphaTab API object uses a link to the 
graphical user interface via a `IUiFacade` to get the available width for rendering. When using the low-level APIs
this width must be specified manually. 

For layouts that grow from left to right the width and height are usually calculated automatically based on 
the contents.

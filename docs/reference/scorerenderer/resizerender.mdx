import { SinceBadge } from '@site/src/components/SinceBadge';

<SinceBadge since="0.9.6" />

import {TypeTable, TypeRow} from '@site/src/components/TypeTable';

## Description
This method can be used if only re-fitting of the score into a new width should be done. 
alphaTab internally keeps all the information about the music notation elements like
where they are placed and how they are connected. This is a rather expensive operation 
but it is only required to be done once. 

In case the UI is resized, this method can be used to trigger a rearrangement of the existing elements
into the newly available space.

## Signatures

<TypeTable>
    <TypeRow type="js" name="function resizeRender()" />
    <TypeRow type="net" name="void ResizeRender()" />
</TypeTable>

### Parameters

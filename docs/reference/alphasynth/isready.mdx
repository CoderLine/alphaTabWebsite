## Description
The audio synthesis engine is running always asynchronously in some worker or thread. 
Before any interaction with alphaSynth can be done it needs to initialize this worker first. 
This property indicates whether the worker is already ready. 

The [`ready`](/docs/reference/alphasynth/ready) event is fired when the value changes to true. 

This event is signaled as soon as the background worker and the audio output are initialized.

## Description
AlphaTab provides 2 main music notation display modes `GuitarPro` and `SongBook`.
As the names indicate they adjust the overall music notation rendering either to be more in line how [Arobas Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com) displays it,
or more like the common practice in paper song books practices the display.

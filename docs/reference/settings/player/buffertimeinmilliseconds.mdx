### Description
The number of milliseconds the player should buffer. Gets or sets how many milliseconds of audio samples should be buffered in total.

* Larger buffers cause a delay from when audio settings like volumes will be applied.
* Smaller buffers can cause audio crackling due to constant buffering that is happening.

This buffer size can be changed whenever needed.

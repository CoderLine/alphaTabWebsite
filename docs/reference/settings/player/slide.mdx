The slide settings allow control how the different slide types are generated for audio. AlphaTab supports various types of slides which can be grouped into 3 types:

* Shift Slides
* Legato Slides


* Slide into from below
* Slide into from above
* Slide out to below
* Slide out to above


* Pick Slide out to above
* Pick Slide out to below

For the first 2 groups the audio generation can be adapted. For the pick slide the audio generation cannot be adapted
as there is no mechanism yet in alphaTab to play pick slides to make them sound real.

For the first group only the duration or start point of the slide can be configured while for the second group
the duration/start-point and the pitch offset can be configured.

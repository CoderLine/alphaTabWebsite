We added support for merging rests spanning multi-bars together (aka. multi.bar rests).
Supported for alphaTex and Guitar Pro.

\\track "Piano 1" "pno1"
    \\staff {score}

\\track "Piano 2" "pno1"

    C4 D4 E4 F4 | r | r | C4 D4 E4 F4 | r | r | r | r |

### Improvements & Bugfixes

#### player: Broken Cursor Display for repeats
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1934

On repeats the bar cursor could behave rather strange moving back to the repeat start instead of transitioning to the end of the bar to the repeat end sign.
With this fix the beat cursor should correctly move again in such scenarios.

#### player: Wrong beat cursor placement when scaling score
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1934

When drawing scores at non 100%, the beat cursor was placed wrongly.

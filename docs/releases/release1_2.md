- [Rendering] Ensure Notation and Chord Diagrams are properly rendered when using a `scale` different than 1.0 (#564)

## v1.2.0

The next release of alphaTab is done. The theme of this release was: 

> Main focus will be improving the visual display by avoiding collisions and improving some visual elements.
 
We tried to avoid any breaking changes on the API level and upgrades should be possible without any code changes. 
But there are various behavior changes where you might want to adopt new settings, values etc.  

This release brings you:

## In alphaTab 1.2 we dropped support for Internet Explorer ‚ùó
One of the biggest changes/decisions we took in version 1.2 is to drop support for Internet Explorer.
This allowed us to make various improvements in regards to performance and more modern code. 
We made [a poll](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/discussions/460) whether dropping IE support is generally accepted, but in case you missed it and have need for Internet Explorer support, reach out to us via [Discussions](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/discussions) and we will see what we can do.

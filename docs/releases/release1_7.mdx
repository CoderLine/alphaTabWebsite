## 1.7.0

Half a year has passed since 1.6.0 and again a new release of alphaTab with new features is available.
I always hope to pace up the release cycles but it always depends on much time I can actually invest into development. 

After all, alphaTab is still mainly a solo project 😁

This release focused on two main areas shipping a great range of new things. 

A special thing about this release is that I developed most changes during my travels this year. That's why some features might 
have taken a bit longer than they would have while developing focused at home. As you might expect, progress is slow if you travel 
through beautiful countries like Scotland , Wales and Japan. 😆

### Music Notation

#### render: Improve SmuFL Spec Compliance
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/2257

> SMuFL is a specification that provides a standard way of mapping the thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the Private Use Area in Unicode’s Basic Multilingual Plane for a single (format-independent) font.
> https://www.smufl.org/

For years alphaTab was using the SmuFL font Bravura to render the music notation symbols. But historically a lot of the visual aspects like spacings, paddings and other arrangements were a custom development originating in the roots of alphaTab.
While music sheets were generally looking good, various aspects of the SmuFL specification were not followed leading into "incorrect" display according to this spec. 

With these changes we have cleaned years of accumulated customizations in layouting the music sheet bringing things closer to the spec.
Not only brings this change alphaTab closer too the expected look&feel compared to other music notation software, it also allows the usage of custom SmuFL compliant fonts.

SMuFl fonts consist of two main parts: 

1. The Font itself holding drawing and text-layout information of the glyphs
2. A separate metadata.json holding SMuFL spec specific details on sizes to use.

To activate a custom font these two things have to be provided to alphaTab. The following example shows the same music sheet with different SMuFL fonts: 

**TODO: add a sample with Bravura and Petaluma**

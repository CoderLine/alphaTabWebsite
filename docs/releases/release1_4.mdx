## 1.4.0

Time flies and its been almost one year since 1.3.0 was released. Hence it is already long overdue to have an official alphaTab release. 

v1.4.0 brings again a lot of new features mainly centered around extending the file format support.

### Music Notation

This version of alphaTab adds quite a range of new music notation features and rendering adaptions. 
The following list is (roughly) sorted by the visual impact of the added feature.

#### rendering: Change on Paddings and Margins
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1524

Up to v1.3 alphaTab was fairly generious with the paddings and margins it defined and there was no possibility to adjust these sizes. 
This way alphaTab required quite a bit of screen space, even for small music sheets. With this feature we introduced configurable
paddings and margins for all general spacings that affect the system and stave placement. At the same time we reduced the paddings
to some more reasonable defaults resulting in a more concise display.

<img src="/img/release/v14/concise.png" />

There is a range of new settings allowing to configure the paddings. 

#### notation: Slash Notation
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1511

alphaTab can now display additionally a slash notation staff. On Guitar Pro 6-8 files the configured staves are respected,
on alphaTex the new `slash` staff option can be used. Or the staff can be enabled on the data model via `score.track[].staves[].showSlash`.

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
\\bracketextendmode nobrackets
.
\\staff {score tabs slash}
1.6.4 1.6.8 1.6.8 1.6.2 |
1.6.4 {tu 3} 1.6.4 {tu 3} 1.6.4 {tu 3} r.2 |
5.5.1 | r.1
`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: Add numbered notation (Jianpu)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1628

alphaTab can now display additionally a numbered notation staff (aka. Jianpu). On Guitar Pro 6-8 files the configured staves are respected,
on alphaTex the new `numbered` staff option can be used. Or the staff can be enabled on the data model via `score.track[].staves[].showNumbered`.

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
\\bracketextendmode nobrackets
.
\\staff {score tabs numbered}
1.6.4 2.6.8 3.6.8 4.6.2 |
5.6.4 {tu 3} 10.6.4 {tu 3} 12.6.4 {tu 3} r.2 |
5.5.1 | r.1
`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: System Brackets & Braces
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1730

Up to alphaTab 1.3 there was always a rectangular bracket drawn across the staves of one track. With alphaTab 1.4 the display is now configurable 
in multiple modes. See [Brackets and Braces](/docs/showcase/general#brackets-and-braces) for more details. 

<AlphaTab tex="true" tracks="all">{`

`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: Track Name Display
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1895

alphaTab has now multiple modes on how to display the track names. The settings are adopted from Guitar Pro and allow a variety of display formats.

<AlphaTab tex="true" tracks="all">{`

`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: Directions (aka. Jumps)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1852

Support for directions (aka. jumps) was added in alphaTab v1.4.0. 

<AlphaTab tex="true" player="true">{`

`}</AlphaTab>

### Player

#### player: SoundFont3 Support (Experimental)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1807

alphaTab 1.4.0 added experiemntal support for SoundFont3 files. In SF3 files audio samples are encoded as OGG Vorbis which allows
a smaller footprint when transferring soundfonts over network. This allows using higher quality sounds without a direct increase of file size transferred to clients. 

The decoding of the audio samples requires additional CPU time which might affect users. Only the samples required by the song played will be decoded to reduce load. 

alphaTab ships now a SF3 flavor of the Sonivox soundfont but still has enabled by default the use of the SF2 file (where embedded).

We did not thoroughly test yet the decoding of many files and the impact of the decoding time. Therefore the support is still considered experimental.

#### player: Live Change of Transposition Pitches
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1642

The [`changeTrackTranspositionPitch`](/docs/reference/api/changetracktranspositionpitch) and [`setChannelTranspositionPitch`](/docs/reference/alphasynth/setchanneltranspositionpitch) APIs allow changing transposition pitches of individual tracks (or midi channels) on-the-fly 
while the song is being played. 

### alphaTex Extensions

#### alphaTex: Support for Percussion Tabs
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1493

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
\\track "Piano"
    \\staff{score} \\tuning piano \\instrument acousticgrandpiano
        \\voice 
            c4 d4 e4 f4 | c4 d4 e4 f4
        \\voice 
            c3 d3 e3 f3 | c3 d3 e3 f3
`}</AlphaTab>

#### alphaTex: Specify Accidentals
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1729

With v1.4.0 alphaTab tries to respect the accidentals as specified when writing pitched notes. 
Additionally accidentals can be forced to the desired one. 

<AlphaTab tex="true" tracks="all">{`
\\track "Piano"
    C#4 Db4 C##4 Dbb4 | 
    \\accidentals auto

### Improvements & Bugfixes

#### API: TypeScript definitions for JSON Settings
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1562
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1578

alphaTab ships now TypeScript type definitions for the JSON flavor of the settings for better
type safety and coding assistence when using APIs like `settings.fillFromJson`, `new AlphaTabApi()` 

#### docs: File Format Compatiblity
We invested quite some effort in documenting the currently supported file formats and features.
For every format we now try to list out what features this format provides and what alphaTab understands from it. 

Head over to the [format docs](/docs/category/formats) to learn more about the feature coverage.

#### rendering: Central Scaling of Music Sheet
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1772

Up to this release alphaTab was handling the scaling of the music sheet across the different places where we draw items. 
This was prone to errors if for some paddings or sizes the zoom scale was applied wrongly. 
To eliminate this problem we moved the scaled rendering into the drawing layer (`ICanvas`). This way
we do not need to handle the zoom level anymore across the whole codebase.

This should result in a more consistent zooming experience and less overlaps.

#### rendering: Tempo Automation rendering (label, positioning and scale)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1906

In this release we improved the rendering of tempo information. Beside the addition of rendering the tempo label again,
we also improved the placement of tempo changes above beats. This was crucial for the `Support for multiple tempo changes in one Bar`.

##### bundlers: Node20+ compatibility for Vite & WebPack Integrations
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1579

With Node20 there were some changes in copying files we had to adapt for the Vite and WebPack plugins. This could lead to wrong file copy steps.

##### audio: Prevent Audio Clipping Noises
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1607
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1609

A really hard-to-catch problem was the generation of strange clipping sounds in some repeat and ending scenarios. 
We improved various bits which could lead to this clipping problem.

#### rendering: Ensure correct effect band sizing on line breaks
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1621
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1641

When during layouting it is detected that a bar doesn't fit anymore into the system (line), it is removed from the system again. 
There was a problem that these "reverted" bars had already reserved some spacings and those were not reverted resulting in strange whitespace. 
This problem was fixed. 

#### player: Scrolling Issue with `ScrollMode.OffScreen`
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1771

There was a problem fixed that scrolling with `ScrollMode.OffScreen` was not working as expected. This was due to wrong scroll properties being used. 

#### notation: Vibratos on Tied Notes with Bends
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1843

There was a problem fixed that vibratos could not be combined with bends resulting in wrong display and audio generation. 

#### notation: Bends on Tied Notes
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/issues/1825

There was a problem fixed that bends were not working when applied to tied notes.

#### alphaTex: Remember Clefs
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1905

Before this change clefs had to be specified on every single bar because alphaTab used some defaults on new bars. 
With this change alphaTab takes over the clef from previous bars.

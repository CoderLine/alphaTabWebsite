## 1.4.0

Time flies and its been almost one year since 1.3.0 was released. Hence it is already long overdue to have an official alphaTab release. 

v1.4.0 brings again a lot of new features mainly centered around extending the file format support.

### Music Notation

This version of alphaTab adds quite a range of new music notation features and rendering adaptions. 
The following list is (roughly) sorted by the visual impact of the added feature.

#### rendering: Change on Paddings and Margins
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1524

Up to v1.3 alphaTab was fairly generious with the paddings and margins it defined and there was no possibility to adjust these sizes. 
This way alphaTab required quite a bit of screen space, even for small music sheets. With this feature we introduced configurable
paddings and margins for all general spacings that affect the system and stave placement. At the same time we reduced the paddings
to some more reasonable defaults resulting in a more concise display.

<img src="/img/release/v14/concise.png" />

There is a range of new settings allowing to configure the paddings. 

#### notation: Slash Notation
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1511

alphaTab can now display additionally a slash notation staff. On Guitar Pro 6-8 files the configured staves are respected,
on alphaTex the new `slash` staff option can be used. Or the staff can be enabled on the data model via `score.track[].staves[].showSlash`.

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
\\bracketextendmode nobrackets
.
\\staff {score tabs slash}
1.6.4 1.6.8 1.6.8 1.6.2 |
1.6.4 {tu 3} 1.6.4 {tu 3} 1.6.4 {tu 3} r.2 |
5.5.1 | r.1
`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: Add numbered notation (Jianpu)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1628

alphaTab can now display additionally a numbered notation staff (aka. Jianpu). On Guitar Pro 6-8 files the configured staves are respected,
on alphaTex the new `numbered` staff option can be used. Or the staff can be enabled on the data model via `score.track[].staves[].showNumbered`.

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
\\bracketextendmode nobrackets
.
\\staff {score tabs numbered}
1.6.4 2.6.8 3.6.8 4.6.2 |
5.6.4 {tu 3} 10.6.4 {tu 3} 12.6.4 {tu 3} r.2 |
5.5.1 | r.1
`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: System Brackets & Braces
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1730

Up to alphaTab 1.3 there was always a rectangular bracket drawn across the staves of one track. With alphaTab 1.4 the display is now configurable 
in multiple modes. See [Brackets and Braces](/docs/showcase/general#brackets-and-braces) for more details. 

<AlphaTab tex="true" tracks="all">{`
\\bracketextendmode GroupStaves

#### notation: Track Name Display
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1895

alphaTab has now multiple modes on how to display the track names. The settings are adopted from Guitar Pro and allow a variety of display formats.

`}</AlphaTab>

#### notation: Directions (aka. Jumps)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1852

Support for directions (aka. jumps) was added in alphaTab v1.4.0. 

<AlphaTab tex="true" player="true">{`

#### notation: Inline Fingering
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1645

With this release the numbers are now displayed beside the respective note head. 

<AlphaTab tex="true">{`
:8 3.3{lf 1} 3.3{lf 2} 3.3{lf 3} 3.3{lf 4} 3.3{lf 5} (2.2{lf 4} 2.3{lf 3} 2.4{lf 2}) |

`}</AlphaTab>

### Player

#### player: SoundFont3 Support (Experimental)
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1807

alphaTab 1.4.0 added experiemntal support for SoundFont3 files. In SF3 files audio samples are encoded as OGG Vorbis which allows
a smaller footprint when transferring soundfonts over network. This allows using higher quality sounds without a direct increase of file size transferred to clients. 

The decoding of the audio samples requires additional CPU time which might affect users. Only the samples required by the song played will be decoded to reduce load. 

alphaTab ships now a SF3 flavor of the Sonivox soundfont but still has enabled by default the use of the SF2 file (where embedded).

We did not thoroughly test yet the decoding of many files and the impact of the decoding time. Therefore the support is still considered experimental.

#### player: Live Change of Transposition Pitches
https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab/pull/1642

The [`changeTrackTranspositionPitch`](/docs/reference/api/changetracktranspositionpitch) and [`setChannelTranspositionPitch`](/docs/reference/alphasynth/setchanneltranspositionpitch) APIs allow changing transposition pitches of individual tracks (or midi channels) on-the-fly 
while the song is being played.

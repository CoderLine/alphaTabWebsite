## What is alphaTab?

**alphaTab** is a JavaScript and .net library for building music notation software and websites. It allows you to take any of 
various supported input files, and embed good looking and feature rich music sheets into your website.

As of today alphaTab is **not** a drop-in component that provides all functionality out of the box. You should rather consider it as 
an **SDK** or **Library** to build components in the way you need it in your website. The needs to music sheets vary from application to application 
and website to website. You will need a certain development skillset to integrate alphaTab into solution.

On high level alphaTab can be structured into the following submodules: 

1. The data model
2. The file importers
3. The render engine
4. The audio engine

All these 4 modules together make up alphaTab and allows you to provide modern and interactive music notation into your website or application. 

## Compatibility

The different flavours version of alphaTab are sharing the same source code. 
We take our TypeScript code and compile it to C# and other languages using a special toolchain.
This way all platforms benefit from the same new features we add. For the future we plan to extend alphaTab to more platforms like Native Android and iOS.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

    { label: 'Vanilla JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: '.net', value: 'net', }

alphaTab follows a "web first" approach and the related package is provided as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coderline/alphatab). Most development and testing happens on this web version.
alphaTab runs on all major and modern browsers supporting ES6. We do not maintain a full list
of browsers as most of modern browsers are auto-updating anyhow. 

**ES6 compatible browsers**

* Google Chrome 58+
* Microsoft Edge 79+
* Mozilla Firefox 54+
* Safari 10
* Opera 55

**Main Web Technologies we use**

* Typed Arrays (https://caniuse.com/typedarrays)
* Map/Set
* HTML5 Canvas (https://caniuse.com/canvas)
* SVG (https://caniuse.com/svg)
* Web Workers (https://caniuse.com/webworkers)
* Web Audio API (https://caniuse.com/audio-api)
* Intersection Observer API (https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_intersectionobserver)
* Resize Observer API (https://caniuse.com/resizeobserver)
* TextEncoder/TextDecoder (https://caniuse.com/textencoder)

alphaTab brings everything you need to get it running in modern browsers, no 3rd party dependencies are needed.

:::note
Internet Explorer support was dropped in version 1.2. If you still need to 
support the Internet Explorer on your website (I hope you don't ðŸ˜…) I recommend
to use version 1.1 where we still had basic IE support. We also do not officially support test against the
old Microsoft Edge before it was based on Chromium.

<TabItem value="net">

The .net version of alphaTab comes as NuGet packages. 

- The [base package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AlphaTab) targets the .net standard 2.0 and can be used in almost all environments using the low level APIs.
- The [windows package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AlphaTab.Window) targets .net core 3.1+ and provides WinForms and WPF UI controls.

The .net version of alphaTab has some 3rd party dependencies for drawing and audio APIs but we try to keep them at a minimum.

## The data model
The data model holds all information about a piece of music. This includes general information like
song title and artist but goes down to individual note level. Everything alphaTab needs to render or play music sheets
is stored in this data model.

## The file importers
To fill the data model alphaTab uses so called `Importers`. There exist various file formats in the market which can hold
the information about music sheets. alphaTab has importers for:

* Guitar Pro 3-5 files `.gp3`, `.gp4`, `.gp5` which are a proprietary binary format from [Arobas Music](https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php?pg=about)
* Guitar Pro 6 files `.gpx` which are a proprietary archive format storing the music information as XML
* Guitar Pro 7 files `.gp` which are a zip archive storing the music information as XML
* [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/) files `.xml` which is an open XML based standard by an open consortium
* [CapXML](https://www.capella.de/CapXML/) files `.cap` which is an open XML based standard by Capella Software
* [alphaTex](/docs/alphaTex/introduction) which is a text based format optimized for writing music notation in a textual format

:::note
There exist many *dialects* of MusicXML and due to its very nature of describing music sheets in a very visual way, 
only a limited subset of MusicXML is actually supported. If you encounter issues or missing features do not hesistate
to contact us on Gitter or GitHub to add support for missing features.

## The render engine
This engine is what makes the music sheet visible. alphaTab takes all the information stored in the data model 
and does a visual layouting and rendering which is called music engraving.

For this, alphaTab builds up a visual tree represntation of all the symbols following the rules of music notation. 
Using this model alphaTab can very efficiently provide dynamic resizing and relayouting. 

The symbols alphaTab is using the [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/) music font [Bravura](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura).

## The player
To bring the music to life, alphaTab comes with a MIDI synthesizer embedded. To play the music sheet, alphaTab will convert the data model
into MIDI commands, which are then played by a MIDI synthesizer based on [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont).

We take the data model, convert it to MIDI, put this midi together with a SoundFont2 into the audio engine and violÃ , we have the 
song being played for human ears. 

alphaTab can provide user interactivity and a visual cursor out of the box.

This was it about the tutorial on how to learn using alphaTab for your projects. 
Next step for you would be to head over to the [reference docs](/docs/reference/settings) 
and learn about the full feature set of alphaTab and what additional features you might want to integrate into your app.

It is up to your experience and creativity to develop more features around this base we build together. 
Maybe you want to build a speed-trainer or add a fretboard/piano display. Whatever you try to build
usually narrows down to the same few steps: 

1. Check the reference docs on what events, settings and API calls exist to fulfill your task. 
2. Add some controls and style them 
3. Hook up the UI with alphaTab using the API object and the events/methods it provides.

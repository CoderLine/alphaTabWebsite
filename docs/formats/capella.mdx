description: The open file format of Capella.

Capella is a music notation software developed by the German company capella-software AG.
> https://www.guitar-pro.com/

Older versions of Capella had binary formats. alphaTab is only compatible with the XML based formats. 
Capella files are Zip archives containing one single `score.xml` file following the [CapXML schema](https://www.capella.de/CapXML/).

**Compatibility Level:** Only very basic support, not well tested

Capella describes a lot of notation elements rather visually than semantically requiring alphaTab to make a best-guess on which exact beats/notes what elements should be applied.

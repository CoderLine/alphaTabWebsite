In version 6, Guitar Pro changed to a XML based file format. The GPX file itself is a custom proprierary container format similar to Zip holding multiple files:

* `score.gpif` - The main XML structure representing the music notation.
* `misc.xml`- An auxiliary XML file holding some display information.
* `BinaryStylesheet` - A binary file holding key-value pairs with various settings around the display of music notation (File > Stylesheet in Guitar Pro). 
* `PartConfiguration` - A binary file holding information on what tracks and staves to show in single and multi-track views. 
* `LayoutConfiguration` - A binary file holding information on what layout to use for displaying music sheets (e.g. zoom level)

Luckily when Guitar Pro 6 was released, the author of the format explained to the community how the encoding works. 
 
**Compatibility Level:** Mature and well tested

> The standard open format for exchanging digital sheet music.
>
> MusicXML was designed from the ground up for sharing sheet music files between applications, and for archiving sheet music files for use in the future. You can count on MusicXML files being readable and usable by a wide range of music notation applications, now and in the future. MusicXML complements the native file formats used by Finale and other programs, which are designed for rapid, interactive use.

**Compatibility Level:** Basic, good test coverage.

MusicXML is a very complex format and often also describes things rather visually than semantically. The format itself is very mature and supports a vast amount of 
notation elements to be described. This also makes it quite complex to handle as applications might have to deal with elements which are not supported by the application itself. 

Additionally the different applications supporting MusicXML have their own slight dialects and expectations to where elements are placed. 
This can easily cause visual discrepancies when exchanging files across applications.

In version 7, Guitar Pro changed to use a zip based file archive format. The zip contains similar files like Guitar Pro 6 but also additional ones: 

* `VERSION` - A file holding version information about the archive. 
* `Content/score.gpif` - The main XML structure representing the music notation.
* `Content/Preferences.json`- A JSON file holding some settings influencing Guitar Pro itself (e.g. to activate the speed trainer).
* `BinaryStylesheet` - A binary file holding key-value pairs with various settings around the display of music notation (File > Stylesheet in Guitar Pro). 
* `PartConfiguration` - A binary file holding information on what tracks and staves to show in single and multi-track views. 
* `LayoutConfiguration` - A binary file holding information on what layout to use for displaying music sheets (e.g. zoom level)

The `score.gpif` is the same as in Guitar Pro 6 but evovling with new features since then.

**Compatibility Level:** Mature and well tested
